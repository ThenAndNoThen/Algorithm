31. Next Permutation
https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/next-permutation/

# Solution
To get the next permutation, we should keep the left part unchanged as much as possible. Replace the xth number and make the right part as small as possible (sorted in ascending order). 

How to find the x? We start from the last number, find the first number x that smaller than its right numbers. In order to generate a smallest number, we need to find the first number that larger than x then swap it with x. In this case, all number at the right of x is in descending order (otherwise, x won't be the first number smaller than the right numbers), so we just traversal these numbers (or use binary search). After swapping, we need to sort right part in ascending order. As they are in descending order, we just reverse them.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length <= 1) {
            return;
        }

        int i = nums.length - 2;
        for (; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i+1]) {
                for (int j = i+1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                    if (j+1 >= nums.length || nums[j+1] <= nums[i]) {
                        swap(nums, i, j);
                        break;
                    }
                }
                break;
            }
        }
        reverse(nums, i+1);
    }

    private void reverse(int[] nums, int start) {
        int i = start, j = nums.length - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            swap(nums, i, j);
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }

    private void swap(int[] nums, int x, int y) {
        int tmp = nums[x];
        nums[x] = nums[y];
        nums[y] = tmp;
    }
}
