11. Container With Most Water
https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

# Solution
Say the max area container consists of line x & y. If we introduce two pointers, start from 1st and nth line respectively. We move one step each time, and compute the area of water, update the max area if needed. Obviously, if we can ensure we wont miss the combination of max container, we will get the correct result. So how can we achieve that?

1. If the height of x <= y, we can say all lines one the left of x is lower than x, otherwise, [x,y] won't be the max container.
2. If the height of x > y, we can say all lines one the right of y is lower than y, otherwise, [x,y] won't be the max container.
   
Regarding the above conclusion, we can compare left pointer with right pointer and move the pointer linked to the lower line so that we would not miss the the combination of max container.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int max = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int area;
            if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
                area = height[left] * (right - left);
                left++;
            } else {
                area = height[right] * (right - left);
                right--;
            }
            max = Math.max(max, area);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
