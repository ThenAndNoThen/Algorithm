55. Jump Game
https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/jump-game/

# Solution
Say if we can reach point x, that means we can stop at any point between 0 and x, so we can reach the max distance jump from any point of them. So we just traversal the nums from the first one, each time we update the max index we can reach. If we are at a index that bigger than max index, it means we can't reach this index, just return false.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int maxIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (maxIndex < i) {
                return false;
            }
            maxIndex = Math.max(maxIndex, i + nums[i]);
        }

        return maxIndex >= nums.length-1;
    }
}
```
